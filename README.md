CS-PrepGuide
One paragraph to describe your project. Your description should include the project concept and key features implemented.

We aim to create a platform that provides information about the different disciplines in Computer Science and the jobs or positions available within each discipline in a particular company in which
they want to get placed. This valuable information in the form of guide provided in our app will help users to make and plan their career path. Once the users have made this decision the users can 
browse through job preparation guides that help the user achieve the skills they require to qualify for the best jobs at companies ranging from the top companies to smaller passionate companies.
This will be useful to fresh Computer Science graduates as well as professionals considering a career change to join the booming IT industries.

## Libraries
Provide a list of **ALL** the libraries you used for your project. Example:

**google-gson:** Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object. Source [here](https://github.com/google/gson)

## Installation Notes
This project zip file can be downloaded and unziped after which it can be opened in Android studio to be able to test and run the application. 

## Code Examples
You will encounter roadblocks and problems while developing your project. Share 2-3 'problems' that your team solved while developing your project. Write a few sentences that describe your solution and provide a code snippet/block that shows your solution. Example:

**Problem 1: We needed a method to calculate a Fibonacci sequence**

A short description.
```
// The method we implemented that solved our problem
public static int fibonacci(int fibIndex) {
if (memoized.containsKey(fibIndex)) {
return memoized.get(fibIndex);
} else {
int answer = fibonacci(fibIndex - 1) + fibonacci(fibIndex - 2);
memoized.put(fibIndex, answer);
return answer;
}
}
